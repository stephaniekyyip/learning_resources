### Unit 1: How to Get Started

- Web Crawler: Finds web pages for search engines by starting from a seed page and following links on that page to find other pages and so on. This collection of data will be used for a search engine.

- Programming

  - A program tells a computer what to do, and it can tell the computer to do almost anything. 
  - A computer by itself can't do anything. It can execute a few  instructions, which can be put together to do what we want in a program.
  - A computer can execute millions of instructions very quickly. The program tells the computer what steps to take.

- Python

  - High level language. Instead of the written program running directly on the computer, it will be an input to the Python program on the computer.
  - Python is an interpreter, so it executes a program written in Python by running a program in a language that the computer can understand. 

- Print the number of minutes in 7 weeks:  `print 60 * 24 * 7 * 7`

- Why do we use computer languages like Python to program computers, instead of natural languages like English or Mandarin?

  - Ambiguity: words can have more than one meaning, sentences can have a variety of interpretations

  - Verbosity:  Natural languages require a lot of text to describe something very precisely.

- Programming language syntax/ rules is synonmous to grammar in natural languages
